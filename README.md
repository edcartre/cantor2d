A Cantor dust fractal generalization implemented in D3.

This is a little experiment to teach myself to code visualizations with the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library. 


You can see a preview [here](http://edcartre.github.io/cantor2d/cantor2d.html). Comments, suggestions and pull requests are very welcome.
